    <p>
        In the chapter one I learnt about that what is important for html? 
        As chapter 1 of CSS3 book says that css is most important part to make 
        beautifull view of any html page. I learnt also basic history of html and CSS
        started. Such as 'HTML past and present', 'writing html for css', 'the
        importance of DOCTYPE', and 'Internet is crucial part to sure updates'.
