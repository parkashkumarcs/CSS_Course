    <h1 class="tagSelector">Tag Selector:</h1>
    <p class="tagExplain">
        Tag selectors—sometimes called type or element selectors—are extremely efficient
        styling tools, since they apply to every occurrence of an HTML tag on a web page.
        With them, you can make sweeping design changes to a page with very little effort. 
    </p>
    <h1 class="classSelector">Class Selector:</h1>
    <p class="classExplain">
        When you want to give one or more elements a look that’s different from related
        tags on a page—for example, give one or two images on a page a red border while
        leaving the majority of other images unstyled—you can use a class selector. If you’re
        familiar with styles in word-processing programs like Microsoft Word, then class
        selectors will feel familiar. You create a class selector by giving it a name and then
        applying it to just the HTML tags you wish to format. For example, you can create
        a class style named .copyright and then apply it only to a paragraph containing
        copyright information, without affecting any other paragraphs. 
    </p>
    <h1 class="idSelector">ID Selector:</h1>
    <p class="idExplain">
        CSS reserves the ID selector for identifying a unique part of a page, like a banner,
        navigation bar, or the main content area. Just like a class selector, you create an ID by
        giving it a name in CSS, and then you apply it by adding the ID to your page’s HTML
        code. So what’s the difference? As explained in the box on page 62, ID selectors
        have some specific uses in JavaScript-based or very lengthy web pages. Otherwise,
        compelling reasons to use IDs over classes are few. 
    </p>
    <h1 class="groupSelector">Group Tag, Id or class  Selector:</h1>
    <p class="groupExplain">
        Sometimes you need a quick way to apply the same formatting to several different
        elements. For example, maybe you’d like all the headers on a page to share the same
        color and font. Creating a separate style for each header—h1, h2, h3, h4, and so on—is
        way too much work, and if you later want to change the color of all of the headers,
        then you have six different styles to update. A better approach is to use a group
        selector. Group selectors let you apply a style to multiple selectors at the same time.
