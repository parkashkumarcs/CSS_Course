    <p class="tagExplain">
        Tag selectors—sometimes called type or element selectors—are extremely efficient
        styling tools, since they apply to every occurrence of an HTML tag on a web page.
        With them, you can make sweeping design changes to a page with very little effort.

    <h1 class="classSelector">Class Selector:</h1>
    <p class="classExplain">
        When you want to give one or more elements a look that’s different from related
        tags on a page—for example, give one or two images on a page a red border while
        leaving the majority of other images unstyled—you can use a class selector. If you’re
        familiar with styles in word-processing programs like Microsoft Word, then class
        selectors will feel familiar. You create a class selector by giving it a name and then
        applying it to just the HTML tags you wish to format. For example, you can create
        a class style named .copyright and then apply it only to a paragraph containing
        copyright information, without affecting any other paragraphs.
